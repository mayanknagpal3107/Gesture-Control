# Gesture-Control
I wish I could control everything with my hands! Sitting in my chair and controlling things like a BOSS. I'd love it! So I finally came out with a cool DIY hand gesture recognition robot, which can follow the commands made by hand gestures. Sounds crazy but I promise itâ€™s very simple. Making a gesture control robot is actually very simple
